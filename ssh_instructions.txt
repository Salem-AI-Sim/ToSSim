After SSH this is the order to do things to run the training script, you can copy and paste this

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y software-properties-common git build-essential curl
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.12 python3.12-venv python3.12-dev
git clone https://github.com/Salem-AI-Sim/ToSSim
cd ~/ToSSim
python3.12 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
pip install transformers trl peft backoff datasets bitsandbytes
pip install --force-reinstall \
  torch==2.7.0+cu128 \
  --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
pip install https://github.com/mjun0812/flash-attention-prebuild-wheels/releases/download/v0.3.10/flash_attn-2.7.4+cu128torch2.7-cp312-cp312-linux_x86_64.whl
huggingface-cli login
(End of one-shot copy and paste, you need to login here)


Something will appear that asks (Y/N say N)
Then you'll have a request to continue press enter
Next is a Y
then 11 followed by 5 (5 is Eastern if you are not in Eastern select your timezone)

---example script
python train.py training_configs/gemma_sft.json

You can flip the order of the torch and transformers download if you would like, I did it this way to try to avoid any force reinstalls caused by dependency conflicts
